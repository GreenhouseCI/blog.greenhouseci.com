[Greenhouse](http://greenhouseci.com) is a continuous integration solution for Android and iOS apps.

Setting up a new project is dead simple, doesn't take any crazy configuration magic and takes just a few clicks. We automatically build your project for every commit you make and run all your unit or UI tests on the emulator/simulator or on real hardware. Automatic build distribution is also supported so that your team and clients are always up to date with the latest state of your apps.


Go take a look at our [demo page](http://try.greenhouseci.com) to see all of this in action.

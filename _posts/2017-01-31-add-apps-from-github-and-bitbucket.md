Good news! Selecting a Git repository for new projects is now easier than ever and can be done via the UI. The main improvement is that you do not have to manually specify the repository details and credentials/private key anymore. 

A procedure which was both cumbersome and error-prone can now be done in 2 clicks. This feature is supported for repositories hosted on Bitbucket and GitHub.

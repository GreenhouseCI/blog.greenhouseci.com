The conference is taking place on 3-4th September in Sweden, Stockholm, one of the startup hotspots in Europe. We decided to sponsor the event as it's one of the best conferences for Android developers in terms of content. The agenda is full of interesting presentations, all worth listening to (you can find the agenda [here](http://droidcon.se/events/stockholm-2015/)). We are especially looking forward to the following topics that relate to our service and dig into different features.

## Cross-platform in 2015 and beyond


Cross-platform apps have been claimed to take over the ruling of native platforms for at least the last 8 years. The debate over this is getting more and more heated with no clear winner in sight. **Erik Hellman from Bontouch AB** is going to compare different state-of-the-art cross-platform solutions and will talk about different approaches to cross-platform development that don’t include html/javascript. This is definitely useful information for developers who are thinking of expanding their application development skillset.

## Gradle: Plugging it in for Build Success

**Lisa Neigut from Electric Objects** will talk about building a Gradle plugin for versioning an Android application and how to customize the standard Android plugin. This talk will give you the starting point for writing your own re-usable Gradle plugins that encapsulate common functionality.

## Expressive functional testing with Espresso

As mobile apps are become more and more sophisticated, testing these apps is also becoming far more difficult. **Maciej Górski**, a passionate Android developer, is going to show how to write real-world functional tests using Espresso taking a production app as a starting point. This talk won’t be your typical “Hello World” example and is instead packed with tips and tricks from the trenches.
If Maciej can get you excited about writing tests using Espresso then jump right in and add some tests to your apps - Greenhouse will pick them up automatically and run them as part of your build process.

## Sustainable Functional Automated Testing

**Mikhail Sedov from Spotify** will give a real world example how Spotify's Android application was developed from a perspective of a Test Automator. He will focus on how to overcome the gap between the amount of effort put in testing and the added value out of it, and how they managed to reduce the cost of writing and maintaining automated functional tests.
We’re all for reducing cost and getting more value out of your automated tests - that’s why we built Greenhouse in the first place.

These are just a few examples of the topics that are interesting for us but there are tons of more great speakers and topics. We are also looking forward (to name just a few) to **Dmitry Avchukhov's** presentation about product analytics at Truecaller and the value of data driven development. **James Nocentini from Couchbase** will teach how to develop an offline-first native Android app and how to set up a CI process so that your Beta testers would have instant access to new features.

We’ll try to listen to as many presentations as possible but that’s certainly not the only reason why we’re at Droidcon. We also have a small demo booth present where we’ll show how to set up a proper continuous integration process using Greenhouse in under a minute. Come check us out and let’s talk about CI, test automation and app development in general.

**See you at Droidcon Stockholm!**

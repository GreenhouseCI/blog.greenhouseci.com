If your team uses [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/), one of the most popular team communication services around, then we've just made your life much more convenient. We added the option to publish your builds automatically to HipChat rooms. Setting this up is a breeze and will take just a minute.

Ever wanted to get a direct link to the latest app version directly in your HipChat room? Now's your chance.
Head over to the Publishing section of your project in Greenhouse and fill in the authentication token and room name.
<a data-lightbox="hipchat-distribution" href="{{ site_url }}/assets/hipchat-publish-add.png">
    <img class="post-img" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/hipchat-publish-add.png" title="HipChat publishing setup"/>
</a>

Every time when a build completes, you'll get a quick ping in your room that includes direct links to the binaries (so you can directly install the new version on mobile) and the release notes (git log).

If you're using a service that we should definitely support out of the box, then [drop us a line](http://greenhouseci.com/contact-us.html) and we'll get right to work :)

Stay tuned for more integrations.

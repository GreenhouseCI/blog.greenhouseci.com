We are really excited to announce that we raised our first seed investment and joined the [Seedcamp](http://www.seedcamp.com) family! Seedcamp is Europe’s foremost accelerator turned investor who has backed 206 companies, with 12 successful exits so far. With a success rate above 75%, it’s The programme many new startups want to be associated with. Greenhouse is now following in the footsteps of some of the most successful Estonian startups like [TransferWise](http://transferwise.com) and [GrabCAD](http://grabcad.com).

In January, we were selected from thousands of startup hopefuls from all over the world to be one of the lucky fifteen who joined Seedcamp’s first batch of 2016. Before that, we succeeded in two important pitching competitions, one at [Slush 2015](http://slush.org), Europe’s biggest annual startup conference, and the other at the Seedcamp Investor Forum in December 2015. In addition to Seedcamp, we are also backed by some of the best-known Estonian tech investors ([Fortumo](https://fortumo.com/), [Mooncascade](http://mooncascade.com/), [Insly](https://www.insly.com/) and others) and now we’re ready to grow!

## So what does it all mean?

Well, first of all, the additional resources have allowed us to expand our team and hire new talented developers to get more great features out the door faster. Secondly, we have hired two new support engineers who are instantly available to help if a user runs into any difficulties while building their application.

## Hassle-free continuous integration is a must

At Greenhouse, we strive to let our customers finally experience hassle-free continuous integration. To meet this challenge, we will continue to invest our best effort into maintaining the high quality of our service, providing plenty of 3rd party integrations, and offering the best support in the industry. With our investors’ and Seedcamp’s support, we can keep growing so that Greenhouse can always meet and exceed our users demands and expectations.

## This is just the beginning!

We believe that it is possible to build higher quality software that’s delivered to users faster. It is so exciting to live at a time when awesome emerging technologies have the potential to let us live beyond the current constraints. However, getting these new solutions into the hands of end-users is often a laborious and time-consuming process.

That is why we want to enable our users to meet the two key requirements of modern software creation: speed of development and delivery, coupled with uncompromising quality. Our first mission is to help mobile app developers to build, test and distribute their apps automatically without any human interaction. And at Greenhouse, this is just the beginning!

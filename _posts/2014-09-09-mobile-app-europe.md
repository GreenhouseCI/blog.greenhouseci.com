We're proud to be sponsoring a great conference for mobile developers - [Mobile App Europe][mae]. The event will take place on September 29th - October 1st in Potsdam, Germany and there are many great speakers [lined up][lineup].

If you're a mobile app developer/QA/designer/manager or just excited about the latest and greatest in mobile development and commerce then join the conference and find us there - we'd love to have a chat with you about continuous integration or mobile development in general. 

**See you there!**

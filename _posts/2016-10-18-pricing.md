When we first launched our continuous integration service in September 2014, we had only a small percentage of the many features we offer today. Hence, we went with pricing based on team size and number of applications rather than resource-based pricing.
<!--more-->

Two years later, we’re happy to say Greenhouse has added many new features such as workflows, support for pull requests, and feature branches. In addition to that, we’ve also made great improvements to our platform’s stability and performance. As our customers have become more aware of the importance of building higher quality apps, that are delivered to end-users more quickly, we’ve seen a surge of interest in features such as concurrent builds and test parallelization. As a result, today we’re happy to announce our shift to a resource-based pricing model.

## New Plans

All paid plans now come with an unlimited number of team members and applications. Prices are based on the available features and number of concurrent builds.  
&nbsp;  

## Here are our new plans:

&nbsp;  

## Key Features

**Concurrent builds** enable teams to release new versions of their apps more quickly. It’s especially important for teams who are working on many different apps or versions at the same time. This has been one of the most popular Greenhouse features amongst our users.

**[Feature branches](http://docs.greenhouseci.com/docs/github-feature-branches "Feature branches")** are an excellent way to encapsulate feature development or set up a sandbox for a quick exploratory spike. In Greenhouse, feature branches are built right alongside a project’s main branch. Our feature branch support is perfect for developers using Git branches to properly organize their development workflow to build and test each feature branch separately.

**[Pull requests](http://docs.greenhouseci.com/docs/github-pull-requests "Pull requests")** are essential for teams to effectively build a project and to ensure everybody is always on the same page. Greenhouse will make sure that all your pull requests are properly built and tested so you can merge pull requests with confidence. We actually go a step further than just testing the resulting merge of the pull request - we automatically re-build the pull request when either the source or destination branch change to give you up to date status on the current state of all your pull requests.

**[Workflows](http://docs.greenhouseci.com/docs/workflows "Workflows")** allow you to define settings for a project’s build in Greenhouse. A single project can have multiple settings over each step in the build process, such as what custom scripts should run during the build, what signing files should be used, how the build should be tested, who should be notified at the end, and how the resulting binaries should be distributed. This feature is especially important for teams who have multiple build configurations, e.g. for debug and release builds and localized builds.

**Team based access control** is for bigger teams with diverse responsibilities and team members who might change quite often as they work on different projects. Greenhouse offers three different access levels:

* Administrator - full access, including billing, adding new team members, and designating access levels
* Member - access to everything except billing and team management
* Limited member - can build apps and look at the related information but no access to configuration settings

**Testing apps on real devices** assures that you’re releasing an app that is thoroughly tested and proven to work on the most popular phones and tablets. Testing on real devices is a crucial feature for teams where app quality is of paramount concern.

The last two features - team based access control and testing on real devices - will be released in the next couple of months. Stay tuned!

Last, but not least, **great support on all plans**. If you were to ask us what we’re most proud of at Greenhouse, we’d say our support. Our almighty developers will provide you their best technical knowledge to help you get up and running. Until now, we’ve given our utmost to be there for everybody but now that we’ve grown, we’re introducing support tiers to ensure everyone gets the support they need. Teams on a Unicorn-level account will get a dedicated account manager, Superstar plan holders get priority support, and the rest of our paid plans receive 24-48h email/chat support. However our free Hobby plan users will be limited to community support via [forums](http://docs.greenhouseci.com/discuss "forum"), all our documentation, FAQs, blog posts, and bug reporting via our “[contact us](https://greenhouseci.com/contact-us.html "Contact us")” page.

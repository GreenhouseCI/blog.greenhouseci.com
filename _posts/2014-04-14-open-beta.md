All our features are *free to use* during the beta phase and we're constantly adding new features and improving the existing ones based on *your* feedback. So keep up the great work and [let us know](mailto:team@greenhouseci.com) how we can make your CI process even easier.

iOS unit test support
---------------------
We [added Android unit test support](http://blog.greenhouseci.com/greenhouse/update/android-testing/) a bit more than a week ago and are currently hard at work adding the same support for iOS projects. As a first step we're going to support XCTest with other frameworks following soon after.

**Stay tuned!**

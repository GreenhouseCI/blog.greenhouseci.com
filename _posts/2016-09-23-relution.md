The enterprise mobility management software vendor Relution and the continuous integration service provider GreenhouseCI are announcing a partnership. They will work together to provide a seamless app development and management experience to enterprises and app development agencies.

<!--more-->
With the integration of Greenhouse into Relution, it will be possible to better help app developers build and manage apps from review to distribution.
Enterprises can now provide their developers with standardized and preconfigured development environments which consist of a source code repository and a continuous integration job for their app projects. With the Greenhouse platform, enterprise apps are automatically built, signed and tested before they are uploaded to the Relution platform. Relution allows all stakeholders in large organizations to better review and distribute apps via an enterprise app store or mobile device management (MDM).

“With Greenhouse we found the perfect partner to provide a build environment for mobile enterprise apps which are managed through Relution. GreenhouseCI is easy to set up and perfectly integrates with the Relution app management platform. This offers a substantial benefit to our customers who can thereby realize the full potential in mobile. They can concentrate on building outstanding features for their business apps and don’t have to worry about technical issues such as the setup of build environments for their apps. The streamlining of the process from development to distribution of apps makes it more efficient and secure for organizations to handle enterprise mobility.”
**Karol Bronke**, Product Manager Relution

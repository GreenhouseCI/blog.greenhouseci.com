As you might have heard, TestFlight [discontinued][testflight-announcement] support for beta testing Android apps. Therefore we're also removing the option to publish your android builds to TestFlight as of today.

*Note: iOS builds are not affected by this change.*

In other news, we'll be adding support for [HockeyApp][hockey] in the near future so you can continue publishing your Android apps for your beta-testers. Keep an eye on our blog for updates.

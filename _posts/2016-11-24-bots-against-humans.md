# Overview

The growing industry of mobile apps is exposing new threats and also opportunities to developers. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robots are getting more advanced, and many tasks in traditional app development can already be automated today. As a part of this transformation, new roles will emerge in mobile app development. We invited some of the best players in the mobile app industry to discuss those opportunities and threats in mobile app development.

(The panel discussion was held at Microsoft Flux, Korkeavuorenkatu 35, Helsinki, 00130 Finland, October 26th 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm UTC+2.)

***“We are already following the rules of AI” - Niko Cankar (Bitbar)***

Don’t panic, Skynet is not out there yet. Still most people are not aware that AI is already taking part in our lives. Apple’s Siri or Google Assistant are on millions of mobile devices that people carry all day long. Even self-driving cars are already tested on road traffic. AI also provides us with navigation, advice and daily information that we need. However, compared with Skynet, most AIs today are domain specific and not that complex. Generally speaking, there are three categories.

* Narrow AI that does a task that it was given to.
* General AI that is capable of grouping information.
* Super AI that is capable of having some sort of consciousness


Super AI is the next step in AI progress, yet we don’t know the point where computational power will be enough for a Super AI to develop. The Super AI is what a lot of people are concerned about. Elon Musk (SpaceX, Tesla Motors) and Stephen Hawking warn about a possible danger for humans coming from Artificial Intelligence. The Future of Life Institute, co-founded by Estonian angel investor and Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn released an AI open letter in 2015. The letter says that “because of the great potential of AI, it is important to research how to reap its benefits while avoiding potential pitfalls."  The letter was signed by AI experts from Google,  IBM, Microsoft, and many others. So it is important that we take actions today in order to keep a safe environment in the future. Isaac, Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics are a classic example of how to establish a safe environment between robots and humans.


1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.


***“There are always people who are not playing by the rules - they play against the rules.” - Triin Kask (Greenhouse CI)***

**What is the next step in mobile development?**

We are slowly moving past the mobile and smartphone because wearables are becoming the next big trend. We already see wearables closer tied to the skin (smartwatches, fitness tracker) However, in the future they might go under your skin, which provides an even more intimate experience for humans. Trendwatcher and futurist Richard van Hooijdonk has already a RFID chip under his skin allowing him to interact with IoT around him. Neurotechnology is researching ways to unlock human potential using wearables (e.g. Halo Neuroscience). Should Android, iOS, and other mobile platforms vanish, developers will be forced to pivot.

Testing needs to cover a huge amount of different devices, operating systems, browser types, and screen sizes. Small code changes might produce severe impact. Even if developers do everything right, there are still a lot of potential problems that might occur.

More and more SaaS companies have emerged to take the hassle out of testing. Greenhouse CI or Bitbar automate the manual grunt work in mobile app development with continuous integration and testing on real devices in the cloud. Are these companies becoming the service points of tomorrow’s software? Or is it as with cars nowadays, where rarely anyone knows what is happening under the hood?

But since software “thinks” different than a human, there’s one potential problem - can we really trust the results of automated tests?

***“The tests are really good at exposing those bugs. They will never tell you that there are no bugs” - Michael Samarin (Futurice)***

Even with high test coverage of 99.9% we cannot be sure. Nonetheless, this is something where test automation will get better at in the future. It is hard to predict what will happen in five years in development. However, the trend of automating tasks in development will definitely not vanish any time soon. Although automation and AI can replace the unpredictable elements of human beings, people will still be the key elements in the development process.

***“It’s hard to get close to the Out-of-the-Box thinking of people” - Marko Kruustük (Testlio)***

# Takeaways

* Artificial Intelligence is already among us
* The point when AI will become Super AI is not sure yet
* Automation is on the rise
* Higher trust in automated tests
* AI can’t tell that there are no bugs - only expose bugs
* Rules are needed today to provide a safe environment in the future (Asimov’s Law)
* Wearables getting more intimate - closer to the skin - under the skin
* AI replacing the unpredictable elements of human beings
* Threat for developers if Android, iOS and mobile environment vanishes, and there’s no replacement
* Potential danger of a Super AI
